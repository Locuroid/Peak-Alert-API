## Peak Energy Alert (PEA)

### Basic Idea

TEP (Tucson Electric Power) instituted a peak electricity program to allow people to save money on electricity. During off peak times, you can use energy as you normally do. During on peak times, however, the energy you use is more expensive. This tool notifies you when your electricity is off peak or on peak.

### Off Peak Times
- Weekends
- Summer Weekdays from 7:00 PM to 3:00 PM
- Winter Weekdays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM and 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

### Algorithmic Steps
1. Checks if the day is a weekday or not. If not weekday: Off Peak!
2. Checks whether it is the summer or the winter.
3. Checks the times for each season.
